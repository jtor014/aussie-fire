## Tech Stack

- **React** - Frontend framework with hooks for state management
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Recharts** - Interactive charting library for wealth projections
- **Decimal.js-light** - Precision decimal arithmetic for financial calculations
- **Modern CSS** - Inline styles with gradient design elements

## Money Maths

All financial calculations use `decimal.js-light` (v2.5.1) to ensure precision and eliminate floating-point rounding errors common with JavaScript's native `Number` type.

- **Rounding Mode**: ROUND_HALF_EVEN (banker's rounding) - ensures fairness over many transactions
- **When to Round**: Only at presentation/display edges, never during intermediate calculations  
- **Precision**: Full precision maintained during calculations, rounded to cents for display
- **Performance**: Negligible impact (<1ms per calculation) for typical FIRE planning workloads
- **Conversion**: `toNumber()` only used at UI boundaries; all core calculations remain in Decimal

## Input Parameters

- Current age (20-60)
- Retirement target age (30-70)  
- Current savings outside super
- Annual pre-tax income
- Annual expenses
- Current super balance

## Calculations

### Tax Calculations
- **Income Tax**: Australian progressive brackets (0% to 45%)  
- **Medicare Levy**: 2% on income above $29,207
- **Medicare Levy Surcharge**: 1% if no private health and income > $97,000
- **HECS/HELP**: Progressive rates from 1% to 10% based on 2024-25 thresholds
- **Effective Tax Rate**: Real-time display of total tax burden

### Investment Projections
- **Returns**: User-configurable (4-12%) with fee deduction
