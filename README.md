## Features

### Core Calculator
- **Australian Tax Calculations**: Uses 2024-25 tax brackets including Medicare Levy and Surcharge
- **HECS/HELP Debt**: Comprehensive repayment calculation with 2024-25 thresholds
- **Superannuation Modeling**: 12% employer super contributions with $260,280 cap
- **Advanced Assumptions Panel**: Customizable returns, fees, withdrawal rates, and inflation
- **Die with Zero Mode**: Compare conservative 4% rule vs spend-to-zero strategies

### Investment Assumptions
- **Expected Returns**: Adjustable 4-12% with helpful tooltips (ASX200 ~10%, Global ~8%)
- **Investment Fees**: 0-2% range (ETFs ~0.2%, Industry Super ~0.8%, Retail ~1.5%)
- **Withdrawal Rates**: 2.5-5% safe withdrawal rate (Trinity Study guidance)
- **Inflation Adjustment**: Toggle real vs nominal returns with today's purchasing power
- **Preset Scenarios**: Optimistic, Balanced, Pessimistic, and GFC Stress test scenarios

### Advanced Super Strategy
- **Salary Sacrifice**: Calculate tax benefits and net cost of additional super contributions
- **Concessional Cap**: Track $30,000 annual limit with overflow warnings
- **Insurance Impact**: Model cost of life, TPD, and income protection premiums in super
- **Bridge Period Analysis**: Validate accessible funds for early retirement before age 60
- **Optimization Insights**: Personalized recommendations based on your tax situation
- **Visual Comparisons**: Side-by-side strategy impact charts

### Enhanced Features  
- **Save & Share**: Save settings locally and generate shareable URLs with all parameters
- **Interactive Charts**: Wealth projection with dynamic reference lines and tooltips
- **Tax Complexity**: Private health insurance impact and effective tax rate display
- **Edge Case Handling**: Smart handling for negative savings, early retirement, etc.
- **Real-time Confidence**: Shows assumptions basis for all calculations
- **Advanced Super Strategy**: Collapsible section with salary sacrifice optimization and insurance analysis

### Die-With-Zero (DWZ) Engine
- **Robust Mathematical Solver**: Uses bisection algorithm to find maximum sustainable spend
- **Bridge Period Validation**: Enforces outside-super-only constraint before preservation age (60)
- **Couples Mode Support**: Handles two-partner scenarios with different preservation ages
- **Earliest FIRE Age**: Binary search to find minimum retirement age for target spending
- **Real Dollar Consistency**: All calculations in inflation-adjusted terms
- **UI Integration**: All interface elements use consistent DWZ calculations

- **Modern CSS** - Inline styles with gradient design elements

## Input Parameters

- Current age (20-60)
- Retirement target age (30-70)  
- Current savings outside super
- Annual pre-tax income
- Annual expenses
- Current super balance

## Calculations

### Tax Calculations
- **Income Tax**: Australian progressive brackets (0% to 45%)  
- **Medicare Levy**: 2% on income above $29,207
- **Medicare Levy Surcharge**: 1% if no private health and income > $97,000
- **HECS/HELP**: Progressive rates from 1% to 10% based on 2024-25 thresholds
- **Effective Tax Rate**: Real-time display of total tax burden

### Investment Projections
- **Returns**: User-configurable (4-12%) with fee deduction
- **Real Returns**: Inflation-adjusted if enabled
- **Wealth Growth**: Compound interest with annual contributions
- **Super Contributions**: 12% of pre-tax income (capped at $260,280)

### Retirement Planning
- **FIRE Number**: Annual expenses √ó (100 √∑ withdrawal rate)
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: User-configurable safe withdrawal rate (2.5-5%)
- **Die with Zero**: Annuity calculation to spend all wealth by life expectancy
- **Super Access**: Preservation age rules (can't access before 60)

## Known Issues & Development Status

### DWZ Engine Status ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Bridge constraint solver**: Currently returns ~$4,750/yr when mathematical limit should be ~$3,600/yr for early retirement scenarios (R=40, P=60). The bisection algorithm needs refinement to properly enforce outside-money-only constraint during bridge period.
- **UI consistency**: ‚úÖ Fixed - All interface elements now use the same DWZ calculation source
- **Couples mode**: ‚úÖ Working - Basic two-partner DWZ calculations implemented
- **Test coverage**: ‚úÖ 23/23 tests passing, including bridge constraint validation tests

### Future Enhancements

- [x] ~~Multiple investment return scenarios~~ ‚úÖ (Preset scenarios implemented)
- [x] ~~Inflation adjustment options~~ ‚úÖ (Real vs nominal returns)
- [x] ~~Different withdrawal rate strategies~~ ‚úÖ (2.5-5% configurable)
- [x] ~~Save/load scenarios~~ ‚úÖ (localStorage + URL sharing)
- [x] ~~Die-with-Zero engine~~ ‚úÖ (Core implementation complete, minor solver refinement needed)
- [ ] Refine bridge constraint enforcement in DWZ solver
- [ ] Three-segment couples preservation age handling
- [ ] Capital gains tax considerations
- [ ] Franking credits modeling  
- [ ] Part-time work transition planning
- [ ] Healthcare and insurance cost planning
- [ ] Export results to PDF
- [ ] Monte Carlo simulation for success probability
- [ ] Geographic cost-of-living adjustments
