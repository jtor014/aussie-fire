# Feature Specifications

## 1. COUPLES MODE (Critical - Most Users Have Partners)

### Why Critical:
- Single person FIRE is rare - most have partners/families
- Tax optimization completely changes with couples
- Super strategies differ significantly
- Expenses don't double (economies of scale)

### Implementation:
```javascript
// Add to state
const [coupleMode, setCoupleMode] = useState(false);
const [partnerIncome, setPartnerIncome] = useState(0);
const [partnerSuper, setPartnerSuper] = useState(0);
const [partnerAge, setPartnerAge] = useState(30);
const [sharedExpenses, setSharedExpenses] = useState(true);

// Key calculations
- Combined tax optimization
- Spousal super contribution benefits
- Age Pension for couples ($1,653/fortnight vs $1,096 single)
- Optimal retirement timing for both
```

### UI Changes:
- Toggle: "Planning as a couple"
- When enabled, show partner inputs
- Split vs combined expense options
- Show both partners' retirement ages

## 2. ENHANCED DIE WITH ZERO

### Current: Die with $0
### Enhancement: "Leave a Legacy" Options

```javascript
const [leaveForKids, setLeaveForKids] = useState(false);
const [inheritanceTarget, setInheritanceTarget] = useState(0);
const [numberOfKids, setNumberOfKids] = useState(2);

// Calculations
- Adjust spend-down to preserve inheritance
- No inheritance tax in Australia (but CGT implications)
- Show impact: "Leaving $500k means working 2 more years"
- Per-child amount display
```

### UI:
```
Die with Zero Mode:
[ ] Spend it all
[ ] Leave inheritance: $______
    Split between ___ beneficiaries
    = $XXX each
    Cost: X extra years of work
```

  }
]);
